Atomise website bottom third - from "The latest from atomist"

FEATURES:
1) Latest News Articles
  > Image
  > Byline (author of article or source of video)  
  > Beginning of article or video summary, trails of
  > link to "read more" or "watch video"
  
  There are three columns of equal width across the page, each column contains a section as set out above and the three columns.
  Site uses a carousel to move between 9 articles/videos in total (3 per page as it were). There are also buttons on either side to indicate
  left or right to allow user to move through carousel faster than automatic timing.
  Clicking anywhere on the column section links to the article or video.
  
  Possible solutions for this feature:
  > Carousel feature
  > Use grid system to generate columns
  > Image/video cards at top, then article for main text?
  > Image acts as link, 'read more' or 'watch video' acts as link, text acts as link - ALL LINKS OPEN IN NEW TAB - target_blank
  
 2) Would You Like To Know More 
 > Title
 > Byline text - link to slack community (new tab - target_blank) and link to chat bot modal
 > Request demo button
 
 Possible solutions for this feature:
 > link to slack community page - target_blank (new tab)
 > Modal used for chat bot with chat feature (this functionality is beyond our scope but we can create a modal replicating chat bot)
 > Could use framework such as bootstrap to create modal and for grid system above or use CSS to create modal box.
 > Button and link in text both trigger modal chat bot.
 > Button again could use bootstrap framework or HTML/CSS - discuss whether we want to utilise a framework or not.
 
 3) Footer
 > Horizontal footer bar with links to 6 pages /sections - ABOUT US, CAREERS, TERMS, PRIVACY, BLOG, CONTACT
 > Each link opens in the same browser window.
 
 Possible Solutions for this feature:
 > Horizonatal navigation bar - again pros and cons of framework vs not.
 > no target_blank as links open in same page - our links should take us to a new page but as we are focusing on cloning the home page for
 now any additional pages should be placed in the 'if we have time' category.
 
 4) Stay in the know, subscribe now
 > Form with email address field and submit button
 > Placeholder text for email field is "Email address"
 > Button reads "Subscribe"
 > If non-valid email address submitted new page opens up with a full form to confirm correct email and other details.
 > if valid email format is submitted - new page - opens in same browser - subscription confirmed - address of company - add us to your address
 book link. Two buttons - "continue to website" or "manage your preferences"
 
 Possible solutions for this feature:
 > Email form - placeholder text
 > html validate email - new page trigger if not with invalid form
 > sumbit button - subscribe text
 > one central column
 
 5) Credits /copyright
 > Credits and copyright text
 > link to twitter through icon and text - opens in same browser not in new tab
 > Chat icon bottom right (this opens up chat modal and moves with page as you scroll)
 
 Possible solutions for this feature:
 > Font-awesome icons for twitter icon - css styling twitter blue and link to twitter page
 > Chat bot icon - fixed footer? Again opens modal as discussed above.
 > link to twitter in same browser window - no target_blank.
